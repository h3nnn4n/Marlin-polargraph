# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware


This is a fork of Marlin Firmware for the makelangelo from
[here](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Marlin-polargraph). This repository
contains my personal changes to match my own polargraph style drawing robot,
nothing fancy here.

More info about Marlin itself can be found in the [Marlin Home
Page](https://marlinfw.org/).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in
open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you
use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you
must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code
to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the
Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your
modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC,
etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you
choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
